# Network-Sniffer
Network Sniffer Python Script -
This project involves building a basic network sniffer using Python and the Scapy library. The script captures network traffic in real-time and analyzes the captured packets to extract and display relevant information. It provides insights into the structure of network packets and the flow of data across a network, covering various protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP. The output is presented in a readable format to facilitate easy analysis and understanding of network traffic.
